NAME
    Pea?rl icons - This is a test

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    In the beginning ActiveState neglected to include an icon in their port
    of PERL. I sent them sample icons ( wpearl formerly pearl1, gpearl
    formerly pearl2, and ipearl formerly pearl3; bpearl was added later).
    Whether they heeded my letter or someone else's ActiveState finally
    began including an icon in build 5xy. However it is a rather
    unattractive one. A yellow pearl to me would denote poor quality. Thusly
    I make my icons available to you in share/; my personal favorite being
    ipearl. Smaakelijk!
